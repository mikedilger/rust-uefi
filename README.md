# rust-uefi

This is a fork of [Mischief](https://github.com/mischief/rust-uefi)'s crate,
with merges and cherry-picks from several other forks
([csssuf](https://github.com/csssuf/rust-uefi) and [orumin](https://github.com/orumin/rust-uefi))

If you build the documentation (`cargo doc`) you'll find there is a good start on
documentation (mostly thanks to csssuf).  This README is really just a placeholder.

I would very much prefer other people (mischief? csssuf?) to own and drive this crate, and
for this fork to "go away".  I crated this crate to pull together features scattered across
several other forks, which I needed for my own project.  Use at your own risk - I do not
expect it to last for long.
